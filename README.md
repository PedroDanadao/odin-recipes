# odin-recipes
My first project of The Odin Project

This project is a small web site with recipes. There will be an index
page(home) and each recipe will have it's own page(like a regular recipes
web site).
Since this is an introdutory project I will mostly use HTML. Maybe a bit
of CSS and JavaScript down the line.
